# FÃ¡bio Esteves' personal website

I used to have a personal website created in Carrd. 
While I was learning web development through The Odin Project, my subscription expired. Instead of re-subscribing, I thought "why not create it myself as a way to test what I already know?"

This website is the result. I also save 19 USD annually, which is cool.
